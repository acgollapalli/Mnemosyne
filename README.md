# Mnemosyne is a novel.

I'm putting it up here so that anyone can see the novel as it morphs over time and eventually reaches publishable status.

All the stuff in the directory "Mnemosyne Archive" is stuff I've written over the past 4 years.
Some of it might appear in the final product. Alot of it won't.

All the stuff in "Mnemosyne.org" is what I'm working on atm. 
This is the working file and current state of what would eventually be published.
